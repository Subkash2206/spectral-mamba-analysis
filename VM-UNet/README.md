# Spectral Fingerprints of Vision Architectures

## TL;DR: Unmasking Spectral Artifacts
This study performs a rigorous spectral audit of Mamba-based architectures (VM-UNet). We discover that the previously reported "Spectral Debt" (a global correlation between aliasing and boundary precision) was largely an **evaluation artifact** caused by uncentered 2D-FFTs (DC component bias). Once mean-centered, the linear correlation between total alias volume and Boundary F1 collapses to near-zero (+0.05). However, we reveal a unique **Dual-Stage Spectral Behavior** in Mamba: it exhibits high aliasing in early encoding stages (Level 1) but transitions to aggressive low-pass filtering in deep stages (Level 4), unlike the more uniform spectral profiles of CNNs and Transformers.

## Abstract
This repository contains a comparative spectral analysis of three dominant architectural paradigms in medical image segmentation: Convolutional Neural Networks (UNet-ResNet50), Vision Transformers (Swin-Tiny), and State-Space Models (VM-UNet). Following a methodological correction—enforcing mean-centered feature maps to remove DC-offset bias—we re-evaluate the "Spectral Debt" hypothesis. Our key finding is the **"Correlation Collapse"**: the pooled AVR–BF1 Pearson r is **+0.041 (p=0.102)**, statistically indistinguishable from zero. While Mamba exhibits a unique dual-stage fingerprint (Level 1 AVR **0.4600**, Level 4 AVR **0.1346**), this does not translate to a global boundary precision deficit. Mamba's O(N) linear scaling advantage over Transformer's O(N²) quadratic attention is therefore not offset by any statistically verified spectral cost.

## 2. Core Scientific Findings

### A. Dual-Stage Spectral Dynamics
By mean-centering feature maps before computing the 2D-FFT, we isolate genuine high-frequency content from activation magnitude biases. This reveals that Mamba's "Spectral Debt" is concentrated in early stages.

#### Stage-wise Alias Volume Ratio (AVR, mean-centered)
| Resolution Level | UNet AVR | Swin-UNet AVR | VM-UNet AVR |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Level 1 (~64×64)** | 0.3427 | 0.3276 | **0.4600** |
| **Level 2 (~32×32)** | 0.3613 | 0.3744 | **0.3840** |
| **Level 3 (~16×16)** | 0.2974 | 0.2519 | **0.1408** |
| **Level 4 (~8×8)**   | 0.1802 | 0.3623 | **0.1346** |

#### Frequency Band Decomposition, Mamba (mean-centered)
| Stage | Low Band (<0.25 Ny) | Mid Band (0.25-0.75 Ny) | High Band (>0.75 Ny) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Level 1 (Early)** | 32.15% | 45.08% | **22.76%** |
| **Level 4 (Deep)** | **69.35%** | 27.35% | **3.29%** |

### B. Statistical Correction: The Correlation Collapse
To test the causal link between aliasing and edge precision, we performed a per-image correlation analysis. Once DC-bias is removed, the pooled correlation collapses. 

#### Correlation Results — Mean AVR vs. BF1 (mean-centered FFT)
| Population | Pearson *r* | *p*-value | Significant? |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| **VM-UNet (Mamba)** | +0.109 | 0.012 | Yes |
| **Pooled (Overall)** | **+0.041** | 0.102 | **No** |
| **Partial (Controlled)**| **+0.418** | <0.001 | **Yes** |
